# BFS VS DFS Maze Solving

This code demonstrates the implementation of maze solving using breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms. It compares the performance of both algorithms on different maze scenarios.

## Code Structure

The code is divided into the following sections:

- Maze Definitions: Definitions of different maze scenarios.
- Utility Functions: Helper functions for checking valid moves and finding neighbors.
- BFS Algorithm: Breadth-first search algorithm implementation.
- DFS Algorithm: Depth-first search algorithm implementation.
- Evaluation: Function to evaluate and compare the performance of BFS and DFS on different mazes.

## How to Run

To run the code, you need Python 3 installed on your machine. Simply execute the `evalutate()` function at the end of the code. This function will run the BFS and DFS algorithms on predefined mazes and display the results.

## Conclusion

Based on the results obtained, we can conclude that BFS is faster and more time-efficient than DFS for maze solving. Additionally, DFS may not always provide the optimal solution.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to solve your own maze scenarios and further compare the performance of BFS and DFS algorithms.
